# ðŸ”¥ Hephaestus Forge - ðŸš§ work in progress

A visual, non-linear audio synthesis application for  industrial sound design.

## Overview

Hephaestus Forge is a real-time audio synthesis engine built in Go, designed to create industrial-styled music with algorithmic composition features. Instead of traditional timeline-based DAWs, it uses a visual grid system where "Travelers" move along paths, triggering synthesis events in real-time (multiple parts of this functionality are yet to built - more coming over time).

## Features

### Current (Phase 1)

- âœ… Real-time audio engine with PortAudio
- âœ… Multiple oscillator types (sine, saw, square, triangle, noise)
- âœ… Biquad filter system (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch)
- âœ… Effects chain (delay, distortion, chorus, bit crusher)
- âœ… Thread-safe parameter management
- âœ… Low-latency audio processing

### Planned

- ðŸš§ Visual grid-based interface
- ðŸš§ Path-based sequencing with Travelers
- ðŸš§ Granular synthesis engine
- ðŸš§ Advanced modulation routing
- ðŸš§ MIDI input support
- ðŸš§ Preset management system
- ðŸš§ Migration to Rust for performance
